# Vite Scaffolding

## Vite instalation
First of all, we need to install the vite package to start creating projects. This we can do in two different ways: 
  - Standard installation: ```sudo apt-get install create-vite```
  - By creating a new vite project directly: ```npm init vite```.
If done this way,we'll get this message: 

![vite-installation](./assets/vite-installation.jpg)

To which we'll want to say yes, and after installing it a menu will appear, where we can choose our prefered options: 

![vite-installer-options](./assets/vite-installer-options.jpg)


But if we did the standard installation, now we need to execute ```npm init vite``` to get the scaffolding done.

Once the project is created we just have to follow the instructions to move into the folder and install the dependencies.
